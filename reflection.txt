1,Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.
In my implementation, I have two pid: one is for steer_value, another is for speed.
For the steer_value, p component defines how hard we turn the steer according to cte.
I component defines a bias on left or right, in this project the car goes anti-clockwise around a lake, so we set i value to make it more easier to turn left.
D component take the gradient of cte into account, so when error changes fast we steer harder, when error changes slower we steer lighter, which will make driving smoother.

The PID for speed in my implementaion is meant to make speed slower when error is large, and I only use p component.


2,Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.
The twiddle param optimisation method is not very practical in this project. Because the average error during a period is highly rely on initial state, to test different params under same conditions, I need manually restart simulator, then the tuning process can't be automatically. The params in submitted project is tuned manully.

I set speed to a low spped(0.2) first, then set i and d component to 0 for steer, then testing different value for p:0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, pick the best one. Then test different i value, then d value.
